**Ownable**

Contract module which provides a basic access control mechanism, where
 there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to
 specific functions.
 By default, the owner account will be the one that deploys the contract. This
 can later be changed with {transferOwnership}.
 This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the modifier
 `onlyOwner`, which can be applied to your functions to restrict their use to
 the owner.

## Contract Members
**Constants & Variables**

```js
address private _owner;

```

**Events**

```js
event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);
```

## Modifiers

- [onlyOwner](#onlyowner)

### onlyOwner

Throws if called by any account other than the owner.

```js
modifier onlyOwner() internal
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|

## Functions

- [constructor()](#)
- [owner()](#owner)
- [renounceOwnership()](#renounceownership)
- [transferOwnership(address newOwner)](#transferownership)

### 

Initializes the contract setting the deployer as the initial owner.

```js
function () internal nonpayable
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|

### owner

returns(address)
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|

### renounceOwnership

Leaves the contract without owner. It will not be possible to call
 `onlyOwner` functions anymore. Can only be called by the current owner.
 NOTE: Renouncing ownership will leave the contract without an owner,
 thereby removing any functionality that is only available to the owner.

```js
function renounceOwnership() public nonpayable onlyOwner 
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|

### transferOwnership

Transfers ownership of the contract to a new account (`newOwner`).
