**ERC20**

Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 to implement supply mechanisms].
 We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 applications.
 Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

### 

Sets the values for {name} and {symbol}.
 The default value of {decimals} is 18. To select a different value for
 {decimals} you should overload it.
 All two of these values are immutable: they can only be set once during
 construction.

```js
function (string name_, string symbol_) public nonpayable
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| name_ | string |  | 
| symbol_ | string |  | 

### name

Returns the name of the token.

```js
function name() public view
returns(string)
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|

### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the
 name.

```js
function symbol() public view
returns(string)
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|

### decimals

Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.
 For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should
 be displayed to a user as `5.05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`).
 Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between
 Ether and Wei. This is the value {ERC20} uses, unless this function is
 overridden;
 NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in
 no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including
 {IERC20-balanceOf} and {IERC20-transfer}.

function decimals() public view
returns(uint8)
