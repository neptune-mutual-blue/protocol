/**
 * @title Reporter Contract
 *
 * @dev This contract allows any NPM tokenholder to report a new incident
 * or dispute a previously recorded incident.
 *
 * <br /> <br />
 *
 * When a cover pool is reporting, additional tokenholders may join in to reach a resolution.
 * The `First Reporter` is the user who initially submits an incident,
 * while `Candidate Reporter` is the user who challenges the submitted report.
 *
 * <br /> <br />
 *
 * Valid reporter is one of the aforementioned who receives a favourable decision
 * when resolution is achieved.
 *
 * <br /> <br />
 *
 * **Warning:**
 *
 * <br /> <br />
 *
 * Please carefully check the cover rules, cover exclusions, and standard exclusion
 * in detail before you interact with the Governace contract(s). You entire stake will be forfeited
 * if resolution does not go in your favor. You will be able to unstake
 * and receive back your NPM only if:
 *
 * - incident resolution is in your favor
 * - after reporting period ends
 *
 * <br /> <br />
 *
 * **By using this contract directly via a smart contract call,
 * through an explorer service such as Etherscan, using an SDK and/or API, or in any other way,
 * you are completely aware, fully understand, and accept the risk that you may lose all of
 * your stake.**
