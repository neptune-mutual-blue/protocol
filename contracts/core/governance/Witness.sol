/**
 * @title Witness Contract
 *
 * @dev The witeness contract enables NPM tokenholders to
 * participate in an active cover incident.
 *
 * <br /><br />
 *
 * The participants can choose to support an incident by `attesting`
 * or they can also disagree by `refuting` the incident. In both cases,
 * the tokenholders can choose to submit any amount of
 * NEP stake during the (7 day, configurable) reporting period.
 *
 * <br /><br />
 *
 * After the reporting period, whichever side loses, loses all their tokens.
 * While each `witness` and `reporter` on the winning side will proportionately
 * receive a portion of these tokens as a reward, some forfeited tokens are
 * burned too.
 *
 * <br /><br />
 *
 * **Warning:**
 *
 * <br /> <br />
 *
 * Please carefully check the cover rules, cover exclusions, and standard exclusion
 * in detail before you interact with the Governace contract(s). You entire stake will be forfeited
 * if resolution does not go in your favor. You will be able to unstake
 * and receive back your NPM only if:
 *
 * - incident resolution is in your favor
 * - after reporting period ends
 *
 * <br /> <br />
 *
 * **By using this contract directly via a smart contract call,
 * through an explorer service such as Etherscan, using an SDK and/or API, or in any other way,
 * you are completely aware, fully understand, and accept the risk that you may lose all of
 * your stake.**
