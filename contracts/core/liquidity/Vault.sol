/**
 * @title Vault Contract
 *
 * @dev When a cover is created, a corresponding liquidity pool is also constituted.
 * An instance of this contract represents the liquidity pool of a cover.
 * The vaults are denominated in a single stablecoin and may be less susceptible
 * to underwriting risks associated with cryptocurrency price volatility.
 *
 * <br /> <br />
 *
 * When requested by the Cover Contract, the VaultFactory contract deploys a vault.
 * Per cover, only one vault is permitted. Since the vault contract is not upgradable,
 * some of the validation logic of it is outsourced to the VaultDelegate contract.
 *
 * <br /> <br />
 *
 * The vault contract is also an ERC-20 token, commonly known as POD (or Proof of Deposit).
 * As there is always on-chain stablecoin liquidity available for withdrawal,
 * PODs are fully redeemable and also income or loss bearing certificates
 *  (loss if the cover had an event that resulted in a claims payout).
 *
 * Unlike [cxTokens](cxToken.md), PODs can be freely transferred, staked,
 * and exchanged on secondary marketplaces.
 *
 * <br /> <br />
 *
 * **Disclaimer:**
 * <br /> <br />
 *
 * **The protocol does not provide any warranty, guarantee, or endorsement
 * for the peg of this stablecoin or any other stablecoin we may use on a different chain.**
 *
 * <br /> <br />
 *
 * Both risk poolers (underwriters) and policyholders
 * must agree to utilize the same stablecoin to interfact with the protocol.
 *
 * Note that the Neptune Mutual protocol only covers risks related to smart contracts and,
 * to a certain extent, frontend attacks. We don't cover risks arising from
 * teams losing private keys because of gross misconduct or negligence.
 * We don't cover people who put their money at risk in trading activities
 * like margin calls, leverage trading, or liquidation.
 * We don't cover 51% attack or any other type of consensus attack.
 * We don't cover bridge hacks and a [whole variety of other exclusions](https://docs.neptunemutual.com/usage/standard-exclusions).
