  about: 'Nexus Mutual is a decentralised alternative to insurance. Nexus Mutual uses blockchain technology to create a risk sharing pool in the form of a mutual to return the power of insurance to the people. The platform is built on the Ethereum public chain. It allows anyone to become a member and purchase cover. It replaces the idea of a traditional insurance company because it is wholly owned by the members. The model encourages engagement as members will get economic incentives for participating in Risk Assessment, Claims Assessment and Governance.',
